					<p>The only issue I had doing this lab was getting my button to print the sorted name. After I had coded the JavaScript and linked it to my html, my button was still not working. After double checking my JavaScript line by line, I misspelled var inputValue as inputValve. After fixing this typo the button worked and printed properly.</p>

		I debugged Lab 10. The TA who graded my assigment noted that I did not implement the nameSort() function. I went back into my assignment and noticed that the sort was not alphabetical. I looked back at my JavaScript code for Lab 10 and added the nameSort() function. I already had the code for my button when I originally did the lab so that didn't need to be debugged. I had an issue with the button not working due to a typo, but after checking line by line, I was able to correct my mistakes.
