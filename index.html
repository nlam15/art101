		<p>My name is Nathan! And I'm a second year AGPM major at the University of California Santa Cruz. My hobbies include drawing and painting, but lately I have been intersted in graffitti culture and tagging. I love listening to music. Pop, electronic, alternative, and kpop are some of my favorite genres. I'm also fascinated by fashion of the past decades as well as newer designers that border on futuristic attire. In my free time when I'm not doing art, I'm watching movies or the latest TV shows. I love any media, or thing, that I can consume, as I am also a major foodie. </p>

		<p>I was born and raised in San Jose, CA, and I am proud to call myself a Bay Arean. I took art classes for about 10 years in my childhood, that's almost half of my entire life! In Junior year I interned at the art classes to be an assistant teacher, and later became an employed table teacher in 2022, mentoring art students in elementary to high school ages. </p>

			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I first encountered issues with uploading photos to my index. Whenever I would try and upload a photo into my index, the code would not link to the picture. I realized after moving my image files around that my images were not in the right file. After transferring all my imgaes to the write lab folder, I was able to properly insert my photos. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was really helpful for grasping the concept of files. Just like the issue I had in this lab with uploading the photos, I learned that it all depends on the location and organization of your folders to achieve a certain action. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here is the index.html file and file structure that I created.</p>
