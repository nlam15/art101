					<h2>Problems</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
					<p id="issues">The only issues that arose was when coding document.writeln, the formatting is very important and it can be easy to misclick and cause errors, which is what I did when trying to print the output statement.</p>
=======
					<p>I had some issues with having the JavaScript show up on the console locally. Initially, it would only show whether numbers in our array were even, and not its square roots. Ater a while of debugging the lab.js, I learned I frogot to put parethesis around the x function. After fixing that, the console showed everything just fine. </p>
