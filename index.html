				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I made a couple mistakes with writing in the JavaScript console. I first forgot to put a comma after each element and so the results were different. I also made a minor error in printing the year. I had put 2022 like on the example instead of the current year, which made my car one year younger than it was supposed to be. Both of these were easily corrected. </p>
