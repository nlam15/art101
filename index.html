			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before coding through a simple computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problems that came up was trying to understand what the lab was asking us to do. We were confused what the pseudocode represented and what the code meant. We then learned the pseudocode was for describing the steps needed to take in order to code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went relatively well and the lab was somewhat straightforward. Me and my partnr decided on the game rock, paper, scissors to pseudocode, as we both are experts at the game and understand its algorithm. We also thought it would be easier than tic tac toe because we wouldn't have to worry about formatting the board. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>
					// Print object selection (rock, paper, and scissors)
					<div></div>
					// Print R, P, or S
					<div></div>
					// Accept user selection
					<div></div>
					// Validate user move
					<div></div>
					// Choose computer move
					<div></div>
					// Interpret each user's object
					<div></div>
					// Determine winner or tie</p>
