					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble getting my elements to show up in my Results. There were a couple errors in my JavaScript code that I caught and fixed, but my elements were still not visible. After asking Elizabeth for help, she noticed I did not put defer when linking my lab.js to my index. After adding defer, my elements were finally able to show. Thank you to my partner Elizabeth! </p>
