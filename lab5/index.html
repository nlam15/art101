					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I initally had problems with document.writeln because I misread the ln as "IN". When I would try to write it in that way, it would autofill as something else. After re-reading the lab instructions, I saw there was a disclaimer about my exact mistake under Task 2. I was then able to finish the code easily. </p>
