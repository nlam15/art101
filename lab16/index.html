					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only issue I had was when I wrote the code and tested locally, there would be no output. I double checked my code but no comic would show. I asked my lab partner Elizabeth for help and she mentioned that we had to download CORS Unblock on Chrome. I did not have this downloaded which is why the comic would not show on my page. After downloading it and enabling it, the comic showed. Shout out to Elizabeth for helping me. </p>
